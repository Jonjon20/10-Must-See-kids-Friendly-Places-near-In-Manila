            <div class="info" id="info7">Basic Info

Location: Sitio Matagbak, Barangay Bagumbayan, Pililla, Rizal. 
</br>
</br>
Contact: (02) 7502‑4294. 
pilillarizal.gov.ph
</br>
</br>
Operating Hours: Daily from ~ 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM (some sources say up to 5:30 PM). 
</br>
</br>
Entrance Fee: ~ ₱200 for adults; ₱160 for senior citizens and kids aged 2–7; kids under 2 are usually free. 
</br>
</br>
What to See / Attractions
</br>
The sanctuary is known for ligers — a hybrid cross between a lion and a tiger. 
</br>
</br>
They also reportedly have white lions, different kinds of tigers (e.g., Bengal, “strawberry”/golden tabby), a puma, as well as more “exotic” or less common animals. 
</br>
</br>
Other animals: camels, mini‑horses, orangutans, birds (like peacocks), donkeys, and more. 
</br>
There’s a small aquarium on site. 
</br>
</br>
Visitors can feed certain animals: food for animals (like chicken legs for tigers) is sold on site. 
</br>
</br>
Photo ops: People have taken pictures with animals like an albino python (for a fee). 
</br>
</br>
Visitor Experience & Tips

According to TripAdvisor and other reviews, it’s not as big or “fancy” as big city zoos like Avilon Zoo, but it’s special because of its “rare kinds” of animals. 
</br>
</br>
One reviewer said a typical visit can take up to about an hour, depending on how much you explore. 
</br>
</br>
They note that feeding tigers costs extra (for chicken legs) and other animals like the camel, donkey, and orangutan are very interactive. 
</br>
</br>


Things to Know / Consider
</br>
</br>

Because it's a “sanctuary” or “holding facility” (not just a typical zoo), some people caution that it's relatively small and that animal conditions might vary. 
</br>
</br>
If planning to visit, bring cash for entrance and for animal feed or photo‑ops, since these are extra.
</br>
</br>
Wear comfortable shoes and prepare for walking — the place is not super large, but there is enough to explore.
</br>
</br>
Given that feeding animals is allowed, check with the staff about what is permitted and what’s safe.
</br>
</br>
Why Visit / What Makes It Special
</br>
</br>
Unique Animals: Seeing a “lyger” (lion-tiger hybrid) is rare, and it's one of the biggest draws.
</br>
</br>
Interactive Experience: More opportunities for feeding or close encounters (depending on animal) than in some larger, more regulated zoos.
</br>
</br>
Local Tourism Spot: It’s a notable attraction in Pililla, Rizal, so combining the visit with other local spots (like Pililla Wind Farm) makes for a good day trip.</div>
